# Xenon2 Inference Engine (Phase 1)

A minimal, streaming RWKV inference engine wrapping [`rwkv.cpp`](https://github.com/RWKV/rwkv.cpp),
built as a small C API (`xenon_inference`) plus a CLI test harness (`test_inference.exe`).

No UI, no voice I/O, no persistence here -- see `../PLAN.md` for later phases.

## Why RWKV / rwkv.cpp

RWKV is a recurrent-style (non-Transformer) language model architecture. Unlike a Transformer's
KV-cache, which grows linearly with conversation length, RWKV carries a **fixed-size hidden
state** between tokens. That's the core property this project depends on for running on a
portable/offline device with limited RAM, and it's verified for real below (not just assumed).

`rwkv.cpp` is a C/C++ port of RWKV inference on top of `ggml` (the same quantization family used
by `llama.cpp`), supporting FP32/FP16 and INT4/5/8 quantized inference, with optional cuBLAS GPU
offload.

## Submodule choice

`rwkv.cpp` is vendored as a **git submodule** at `inference-engine/rwkv.cpp`, pinned to
`https://github.com/RWKV/rwkv.cpp` (the current/active org -- this project previously lived
under `saharNooby/rwkv.cpp`; verified via the repo's own release history before adding it).
`rwkv.cpp` itself vendors `ggml` (and `ggml` vendors `kompute`) as nested submodules, so clone
with:

```commandline
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```

`../models/` (outside `inference-engine/`) holds the downloaded/converted/quantized model
files; see "Getting a model" below. Large model files are git-ignored, not committed.

## The `generate()` API is a real FFI boundary, not a CLI-only hack

`xenon_inference.h` is plain C (opaque handle + POD types + a C function-pointer callback),
specifically so it's callable later from Rust (`bindgen` / manual `extern "C"` decls) or Python
(`ctypes`/`cffi`) without changes, per the project's later phases. `xenon_generate()` streams
one token at a time via a callback (`xenon_token_callback`) -- it does not buffer/batch the
response internally.

```c
xenon_engine * engine = xenon_load_model(model_path, vocab_path, n_threads, n_gpu_layers);
xenon_generate(engine, prompt, max_tokens, temperature, top_p, my_callback, my_user_data);
xenon_free_engine(engine);
```

## Persistent state across calls (Phase 8)

Through Phase 7, `xenon_generate()` reset the engine's RWKV state on every call, so a caller
doing multi-turn conversation had to re-serialize and re-evaluate the *entire* conversation as
text every turn -- paying transformer-shaped prefill costs on an architecture (RWKV) whose whole
point is a fixed-size recurrent state that makes that unnecessary. Measured before this phase:
153 tokens of fixed preamble re-fed every turn, growing to 450+ tokens of history by turn 10.

`xenon_state` is a new opaque, caller-owned handle for exactly this: it lets a caller keep a
conversation's state alive across calls and feed only the *new* text each turn.

```c
xenon_state * s = xenon_state_new(engine);
xenon_state_reset(engine, s);
xenon_prefill(engine, s, "<static preamble text, never changes>");   // one-time cost
// ... once per turn, generate from a throwaway copy so `s` never absorbs unconfirmed output:
xenon_state * scratch = xenon_state_new(engine);
xenon_state_copy(scratch, s);
xenon_generate_with_state(engine, scratch, "User: hi\n\nXenon:", ..., my_callback, my_user_data);
xenon_state_free(scratch);
// once the caller knows the canonical (possibly trimmed) text for this turn, commit it to `s`:
xenon_prefill(engine, s, "User: hi\n\nXenon: <trimmed reply>\n\n");
```

`xenon_generate()` itself is unchanged in signature and behavior -- it's now a thin wrapper
(`xenon_state_new` + `xenon_state_reset` + `xenon_generate_with_state` + `xenon_state_free`) kept
for the two callers that bind this exact signature (`voice-pipeline/xenon_engine.py`'s ctypes
bindings, `test_inference.cpp`). New code (the Tauri app) uses the incremental API directly --
see `app/src-tauri/src/inference.rs`'s `ensure_cache_extended` for the caching/invalidation policy
actually used there: an LRU of per-conversation states, diffed against each incoming request's
history to decide "extend" (prefill just the new tail turns) vs. "rebuild" (an edit or delete
happened; start over from a shared, engine-level static-prefix state).

One subtlety worth calling out here because it's easy to get wrong: **the authoritative state for
a conversation should only ever be advanced via `xenon_prefill` of text the caller already
considers canonical, never by keeping whatever a generation call happened to leave behind.**
Generation should run on a throwaway `xenon_state_copy`, and the real state gets the confirmed
text later. This app's own caller trims/post-processes model output (strips a trailing stop
sequence, a canned-phrase backstop) *after* generation completes, so the state at the moment
generation finishes is not the state the caller will treat as canonical -- committing raw
generation output directly would silently drift the two apart.

Repeat-penalty continuity: `xenon_generate()`'s per-call `recent_tokens` window (tail-256 of the
prompt, used by the repetition penalty) is now `xenon_state`'s persistent `recent_tokens` field,
appended to by every token consumed via `xenon_prefill` or `xenon_generate_with_state` and capped
at 256 from the front -- mathematically the same tail-256 window a full re-feed would compute.
`inference-engine/src/test_state_cache.cpp` proves this equivalence directly: it asserts
byte-identical text *and* token-id sequences between a full reset-and-refeed and the incremental
path, at turn 1, turn 5, after an edited earlier turn, and after a regenerate, all with
`repeat_penalty` enabled (temperature 0 / greedy decoding makes this deterministic without
needing to seed the RNG -- `sample_logits` short-circuits to argmax before touching it).

**Measured (RWKV-7 World 2.9B, this machine):**

| | `xenon_get_state_len()` |
|---|---|
| RWKV-5 World 0.4B (Phase 1) | 1,622,016 floats (6.19 MB) |
| RWKV-7 World 2.9B (current) | 5,406,720 floats (20.62 MB) |

| turn | old (full re-feed): tokens evaluated | new (incremental): tokens evaluated |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | 167 | 55 (+112 one-time static-prefix cost, shared across all conversations) |
| 5  | 280 | 83 (28 extend + 55 suffix) |
| 10 | 420 | 83 (28 extend + 55 suffix) |

The old path grows without bound as a conversation gets longer; the new path is flat. Wall time
for a 20-token reply at turn 10 dropped from 16.97s to 4.65s on this machine (both CPU-only,
un-cached weights already resident) -- run `test_state_cache.exe --benchmark` yourself to
reproduce (`--correctness` runs the byte-identical proof above). Steady-state per-token
generation throughput is unaffected (the generation loop itself is untouched, just operating on
`xenon_state` fields instead of fields that used to live directly on `xenon_engine`).

## Building

`rwkv.cpp`'s C library and this project's wrapper/CLI are built as **two separate stages**, so
that the CPU-only and CUDA builds can live side by side as fully independent build directories
(per the Phase 1 spec -- both must be available, not just the last one built).

All commands assume PowerShell, run from `inference-engine/`. If `cmake`/`nvcc` aren't found,
your shell's PATH/env cache predates their install -- refresh it first:

```powershell
$machinePath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine")
$userPath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
$env:Path = $machinePath + ";" + $userPath
$env:CUDA_PATH = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("CUDA_PATH","Machine")
```
(The last line is only needed for the CUDA build -- MSBuild's CUDA integration reads
`$env:CUDA_PATH` from the process environment, which a pre-existing shell won't have picked up
after a fresh CUDA Toolkit install.)

### 1a. Build rwkv.cpp, CPU-only

```powershell
cmake -B rwkv.cpp/build-cpu -S rwkv.cpp -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DRWKV_CUBLAS=OFF
cmake --build rwkv.cpp/build-cpu --config Release --target rwkv
```
Produces `rwkv.cpp/build-cpu/bin/Release/rwkv.dll` + `rwkv.cpp/build-cpu/Release/rwkv.lib`.

### 1b. Build rwkv.cpp, CUDA/cuBLAS-enabled

```powershell
cmake -B rwkv.cpp/build-cuda -S rwkv.cpp -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DRWKV_CUBLAS=ON `
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="-Xcompiler=/Zc:preprocessor"
cmake --build rwkv.cpp/build-cuda --config Release --target rwkv
```
Produces the same two files under `rwkv.cpp/build-cuda/`.

`-DRWKV_CUBLAS=ON` is rwkv.cpp's own build flag (checked directly in the checked-out
`CMakeLists.txt` rather than assumed); internally it maps to ggml's current `GGML_CUDA` option
(older ggml history also used `GGML_CUBLAS` -- this checkout uses `GGML_CUDA`).

**Deviation from a "plain" build, discovered while getting this working on this machine:**
CUDA Toolkit 13.3's CCCL (`cuda/std/...`) headers hard-error under MSVC's default
("traditional") preprocessor with `fatal error C1189: ... switch to the standard conforming
preprocessor by passing /Zc:preprocessor to cl.exe`, triggered by ggml-cuda source files that
pull in CUB/Thrust-based reduction kernels (e.g. `sum.cu`) -- not all `.cu` files hit it, which
is why a first build attempt got ~70/146 object files in before failing on one of the affected
files. `-DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="-Xcompiler=/Zc:preprocessor"` forwards the conforming-preprocessor
flag to the host compiler for every CUDA translation unit and resolves it. If you're on an
older CUDA Toolkit this flag is likely unnecessary (harmless either way).

### 2. Build the xenon_inference wrapper + test_inference CLI

Point `XENON_RWKV_BUILD_DIR` at whichever rwkv.cpp build you want to link against:

```powershell
# CPU-only app
cmake -B build-cpu-app -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
  -DXENON_RWKV_BUILD_DIR="<repo>/inference-engine/rwkv.cpp/build-cpu" -DXENON_HAS_CUDA=OFF
cmake --build build-cpu-app --config Release

# CUDA-enabled app
cmake -B build-cuda-app -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
  -DXENON_RWKV_BUILD_DIR="<repo>/inference-engine/rwkv.cpp/build-cuda" -DXENON_HAS_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build-cuda-app --config Release
```

Each produces `build-<variant>-app/bin/Release/test_inference.exe` (with `rwkv.dll` and
`world_vocab.bin` copied alongside it automatically by the build -- see "Follow-up fix" below).

## Getting a model

**Note (Phase 7 follow-up, 2026-08-01)**: the desktop app (`app/`) no longer loads the 0.4B model
described below -- it was upgraded to RWKV-7 World v3 2.9B for reply quality; see
`app/README.md`'s "Phase 7 follow-up: model upgrade" section for the full story and benchmarks.
This section is left as-is since it documents Phase 1's own CLI harness / acceptance criteria
against the original 0.4B model, and the same conversion pipeline (steps 2-3 below) is exactly
what was reused for the 2.9B upgrade, just pointed at a different source checkpoint.

Phase 1 uses **RWKV-5 World 0.4B** (~430M params), matched with the **World tokenizer** (World
models use `n_vocab = 65536` and REQUIRE the World tokenizer; Pile/Raven models use the 20B BPE
tokenizer and `n_vocab = 50277` -- pairing the wrong one silently produces garbage output, so
`xenon_load_model` sanity-checks the loaded vocab size against the model's `n_vocab` and refuses
to load on a large mismatch).

```powershell
# 1. Download the PyTorch checkpoint (~924 MB)
#    https://huggingface.co/BlinkDL/rwkv-5-world/blob/main/RWKV-5-World-0.4B-v2-20231113-ctx4096.pth
#    -> save under ../models/

# 2. Convert to rwkv.cpp's ggml format (FP16)
python rwkv.cpp/python/convert_pytorch_to_ggml.py `
  ..\models\RWKV-5-World-0.4B-v2-20231113-ctx4096.pth `
  ..\models\rwkv-5-world-0.4B-FP16.bin FP16

# 3. Quantize to INT4 (Q4_0) using rwkv.cpp's own quantize tool
python rwkv.cpp/python/quantize.py `
  ..\models\rwkv-5-world-0.4B-FP16.bin ..\models\rwkv-5-world-0.4B-Q4_0.bin Q4_0
```
(`quantize.py` needs `rwkv.dll` on its search path -- if it can't auto-find it, point it at
`rwkv.cpp/build-cpu/bin/Release/rwkv.dll` explicitly via
`rwkv_cpp_shared_library.RWKVSharedLibrary(path)`.)

Result: `models/rwkv-5-world-0.4B-Q4_0.bin`, 432.83 MB (from an 881.33 MB FP16 source --
2.04x compression, matching rwkv.cpp's own quantize.py output).

The World tokenizer vocab itself is already converted and checked in at
`inference-engine/data/world_vocab.bin` (see "Repo layout" above); regenerate it with
`python tools/convert_world_vocab.py rwkv.cpp/python/rwkv_cpp/rwkv_vocab_v20230424.txt data/world_vocab.bin`
if you ever need to.

## Follow-up fix: self-contained build output folders (2026-07-31)

Phase 1 was originally verified working, but only when run from the `Xenon2/` repo root, because
`test_inference.cpp`'s default `--vocab` was a path relative to the current working directory
(`inference-engine\data\world_vocab.bin`), and nothing copied that file into the build output
folders. Running `test_inference.exe` directly from inside `build-cpu-app\bin\Release\` or
`build-cuda-app\bin\Release\` (as a portable, self-contained build should support) failed with
`WorldTokenizer: failed to open vocab file`.

Fixed two places:
- `CMakeLists.txt`: a second `add_custom_command(TARGET test_inference POST_BUILD ...)` now
  copies `inference-engine/data/world_vocab.bin` next to `test_inference.exe` on every build,
  alongside the existing `rwkv.dll` copy step -- no manual copy step to remember.
- `test_inference.cpp`: the default vocab path is now resolved relative to the *executable's own
  directory* (via `GetModuleFileNameA`/`get_exe_dir()`), not the current working directory or
  the project root. `--vocab PATH` still overrides this explicitly if you want to point at a
  different vocab file.

Re-verified after the fix by running `test_inference.exe` directly from inside each build output
folder, with no `cd` to the repo root and no `--vocab` flag:

```powershell
cd build-cpu-app\bin\Release
.\test_inference.exe "hello, how are you?" --model "<repo>\models\rwkv-5-world-0.4B-Q4_0.bin" --max-tokens 30
# -> loads and streams normally, no vocab-file error

cd build-cuda-app\bin\Release
.\test_inference.exe "hello, how are you?" --model "<repo>\models\rwkv-5-world-0.4B-Q4_0.bin" --gpu-layers 24 --max-tokens 30
# -> loads and streams normally, no vocab-file error
```

Both build folders confirmed self-contained: `test_inference.exe`, `rwkv.dll`, and
`world_vocab.bin` (plus the runtime DLLs already covered) are all present together in
`build-cpu-app\bin\Release\` and `build-cuda-app\bin\Release\`, and the harness runs from either
folder without any reliance on the working directory or project root.

## Running the CLI harness

Can now be run either from the `Xenon2/` repo root, or directly from inside the build output
folder itself (see the follow-up fix above) -- the default `--vocab` resolves relative to
`test_inference.exe`'s own directory either way. From the repo root:

```powershell
# CPU-only
.\inference-engine\build-cpu-app\bin\Release\test_inference.exe "hello, how are you?"

# GPU-offloaded (all 24 layers on the RTX A1000)
.\inference-engine\build-cuda-app\bin\Release\test_inference.exe "hello, how are you?" --gpu-layers 24
```

Flags: `--model PATH` `--vocab PATH` `--threads N` (default 6) `--gpu-layers N` (default 0 =
CPU-only) `--max-tokens N` (default 100) `--temperature F` (default 0.8) `--top-p F` (default
0.5) `--repeat-penalty F` (default 1.3, matches `app/`'s tuned value -- see "Repetition penalty"
below; 1.0 disables it) `--measure-memory` (print periodic working-set samples to stderr)
`--no-stop` (disable the harness's own `\n\nUser:` stop-sequence heuristic, useful for long
benchmark/memory runs).

### Repetition penalty (Phase 7 follow-up, 2026-08-02)

`xenon_generate` originally had no repetition penalty at all -- just temperature + top-p. Real
usage of the desktop app showed a real failure mode this caused: since the app resent the full
conversation history as text on every call (no incremental RWKV state across calls -- Phase 8
later added that, see "Persistent state across calls" above, and carried the same repeat-penalty
window forward as `xenon_state`'s persistent `recent_tokens` field), once the model produced a
canned phrase once, that phrase became part of every later prompt and the model started imitating
it for unrelated questions instead of answering them. Added a standard
llama.cpp-style penalty (`sample_logits` in `xenon_inference.cpp`) applied to any token seen in the
last 256 tokens of the prompt tail *plus* everything generated so far this call -- deliberately
covering the prompt tail, not just this call's own output, since the failure mode was echoing
something from earlier history, not self-repeating within one reply. Empirically tuned by replaying
the actual failure conversation at different values: 1.0 and 1.15 (llama.cpp's typical low end)
still fell into the trap; 1.3 (the typical high end) broke it, with no observed quality loss on
normal exchanges. See `app/README.md`'s "Repetition-penalty engine fix" section for the full
before/after evidence.

`--gpu-layers` granularity: rwkv.cpp's C API (`rwkv_init_from_file(path, n_threads,
n_gpu_layers)`) takes a real per-layer offload count, the same granularity as llama.cpp -- this
is not an "all-or-nothing" flag being faked. `--gpu-layers` is a no-op (silently ignored, stays
CPU-only) if `test_inference.exe` was built from `build-cpu-app` (no CUDA support compiled in);
`xenon_has_gpu_support()` reports which build you're running.

The harness prompt-formats your input into a small "User: ... / Xenon: ..." chat prime (matching
rwkv.cpp's own `python/prompt/English-Chat.json` convention) so a small base-ish World model
gives a coherent turn instead of an open-ended continuation, and stops generation early once it
sees a new `\n\nUser:` turn begin.

## Acceptance criteria -- verified results

All measurements below were taken on the dev machine (i7-12850HX, 32GB RAM, RTX A1000 Laptop
GPU 4GB VRAM), prompt `"hello, how are you?"`, model `rwkv-5-world-0.4B-Q4_0.bin` (24 layers).

### 1. Loads + streams a coherent response to a basic greeting in under 2 seconds

CPU-only:
```
$ test_inference.exe "hello, how are you?" --max-tokens 60
xenon_inference: model loaded in 0.311 sec.
hello, how are you? I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I'm working on a project that
I'm excited about. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better.
time to first token: 0.262 sec
total generation time: 0.958 sec (35 tokens, stopped at natural turn end)
throughput: 36.53 tokens/sec
```
Model load + time-to-first-token = **0.31s + 0.26s ≈ 0.57s**, well under 2s. PASS.

GPU-offloaded (`--gpu-layers 24`, all layers on the RTX A1000):
```
$ test_inference.exe "hello, how are you?" --gpu-layers 24 --max-tokens 60
ggml_cuda_init: found 1 CUDA devices:
  Device 0: NVIDIA RTX A1000 Laptop GPU, compute capability 8.6, VMM: yes
xenon_inference: model loaded in 0.528 sec.
hello, how are you? I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I'm feeling a bit tired, but I'm
feeling more energetic today. I'm just trying to get some work done.
time to first token: 0.161 sec
total generation time: 1.052 sec (37 tokens, stopped at natural turn end)
throughput: 35.17 tokens/sec
```
Model load + time-to-first-token = **0.53s + 0.16s ≈ 0.69s**, well under 2s. PASS.

### 2. Memory stays flat as generation proceeds (fixed-size RWKV state, not a growing cache)

250-token CPU-only generation (`--max-tokens 250 --no-stop --measure-memory`), working-set
sampled every 10 tokens:

| tokens generated | working set |
|---|---|
| 10  | 595.50 MB |
| 50  | 595.42 MB |
| 100 | 595.42 MB |
| 150 | 595.42 MB |
| 200 | 595.42 MB |
| 250 | 595.42 MB |

Total drift across 240 additional tokens: **0.08 MB** (noise-level, not growth).

The same test in GPU-offloaded mode (`--gpu-layers 24 --max-tokens 250 --no-stop --measure-memory`)
is, if anything, flatter -- host-process working set held at exactly **710.47 MB** for every
sample from token 10 through token 250 (zero measurable drift; the RWKV state for GPU-offloaded
layers lives in VRAM, not host RAM, so host working set is even less token-count-sensitive).

The RWKV state
buffer itself is a fixed `state_len = 1,622,016` floats = 6.19 MB regardless of how many tokens
have been generated (`xenon_get_state_len()` returns the same value before and after
generation -- it's allocated once at model load and reused in place every step via
`rwkv_eval(ctx, token, state, state, logits)`, never reallocated or grown). This confirms RWKV's
fixed-size-state property directly, rather than assuming it. PASS.

### 3. Tokens print to stdout incrementally, not batched at the end

Confirmed by eye (visible per-token streaming during interactive runs) and by construction: the
CLI's `on_token` callback calls `fputs` + `fflush(stdout)` immediately for each token as
`xenon_generate`'s callback loop invokes it (see `test_inference.cpp`), inside the same
`rwkv_eval` step-by-step loop used for timing -- there is no buffering point where a full
response is assembled before any output happens. PASS.

### 4. GPU-offloaded mode is at least as fast as CPU-only

**Honest result: NOT faster for steady-state throughput at this model size -- documented here
rather than hidden, per the spec's explicit instruction to do so if this happened.**
Time-to-first-token IS meaningfully faster on GPU. See full numbers below.

## CPU vs GPU benchmark

Controlled benchmark: identical prompt (`"hello, how are you?"`), identical model
(`rwkv-5-world-0.4B-Q4_0.bin`, 24 layers, all offloaded in the GPU case), fixed 200-token
generation with the harness's stop-sequence heuristic disabled (`--max-tokens 200 --no-stop`)
so both runs generate the exact same amount of work. Two runs each, back to back:

| Mode | Model load | Time to first token | 200 tokens in | Throughput |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPU-only (6 threads) | 0.31s | 0.220s / 0.235s | 3.999s / 4.048s | **50.01 / 49.40 tok/s** |
| GPU-offloaded (24/24 layers, RTX A1000) | 0.53s | **0.133s / 0.135s** | 4.884s / 4.944s | 40.95 / 40.45 tok/s |

**Time-to-first-token is ~40% faster on GPU** (0.13s vs 0.22-0.24s) -- consistent with the
initial prompt-processing pass being a larger, more GPU-friendly batched matmul.

**Steady-state per-token throughput is ~18-20% SLOWER on GPU** than CPU-only (40.5-41.0 tok/s
vs 49.4-50.0 tok/s). This matches the Phase 1 spec's own caveat that this is "plausible for a
model this small": single-token RWKV decode issues many small CUDA kernel launches per layer
(24 layers x several ops each), and at batch size 1 with a 430M-parameter model, kernel-launch
and host<->device synchronization overhead outweighs the compute-throughput advantage the GPU
would have at larger batch sizes or larger models. rwkv.cpp's own README documents the same
pattern for its 169M-parameter cuBLAS benchmark (CPU threads competitive with or beating GPU at
low thread counts on a small model).

**Net verdict**: GPU offload is real, correctly wired (`n_gpu_layers` is a true rwkv.cpp C API
parameter, confirmed offloading via the `ggml_cuda_init` device log line and via VRAM usage),
and improves latency-to-first-response -- but for this specific ~430M model size, CPU-only is
the better choice for sustained generation throughput on this GPU. This isn't hidden or worked
around: `--gpu-layers` defaults to 0 (CPU-only) exactly as the spec requires, and a caller who
cares more about steady-state tok/s than initial latency should leave it at the default. A
larger RWKV model (1.5B+) would likely flip this result, since compute cost per kernel launch
would grow faster than the fixed launch overhead -- untested here, out of scope for Phase 1's
430M model target.
